# NFTCollection

Hello! Welcome to the app that gives users an intimate and unique experience of viewing the top selling NFTs (Non-fungible Tokens), similar to if you were going to a gallery!

This app is built using React and GraphQL.

This app is currently in progress, but you can follow my progress anyways. In the future, the website will be hosted.
